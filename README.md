# trips
processing TRIPS

Usage:
python parse_trips_xml.py --path PATH-TO-DIRECTORY-WITH-TRIPS-XMLs > error.log

The clean XMLs corresponding to the original TRIPS XMLs will be created in the same directory containing the original XMLs. If any of the original XML files did not contain the parses, the filenames will be added to error.log .
